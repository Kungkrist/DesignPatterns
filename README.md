# DesignPatterns
## Composite Design Pattern
### Uses:
Use the Composite pattern when: 
..* You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
..* You want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.
